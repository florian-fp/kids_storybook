A gentle breeze carried him out the window, over trees, rooftops, and a surprised cat! \"Wheee!\" Benny sang, swirling with butterflies and dancing with dandelions. But POP!â€”a bird nearly bumped him. \"Careful!\" Benny laughed, bouncing higher. As the sun began to set, Benny sparkled like a tiny rainbow. Finally, he gently landed on a little girl's nose. She giggled, and Benny smiled, proud to have flown so far. And with a pop, he was gone.",
