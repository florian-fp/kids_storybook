# Image generation prompts
IMAGE_PROMPT_BREAKDOWN = """
Break down the following story content into {nb_images} image prompts.

# Guidelines:
Each prompt needs to respect the following guidelines:
- The images should capture evenly spaced moments of the story
- The images should be consistent in style and across characters. E.g., if a story character is used in several pictures, this character should look like the same character even if in different situations.
- Characters need to be described in details
- Style of images should be appropriate for a {target_age}-year-old
- Prompts need to be optimized for ChatGPT image generation
